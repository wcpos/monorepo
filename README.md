## 💡 About

The goal of this project is to develop a <u>free</u> and <u>extensible</u> Point of Sale application with first-class support for collecting payment via cryptocurrency.

Currently the application requires [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com) to provide the backend database, but it should not necessarily be limited to WooCommerce.

This monorepo contains all the code necessary to build the client applications. To use with WooCommerce you will need to also install the [WooCommerce POS plugin for WordPress](https://github.com/wcpos/woocommerce-pos).

## 📁 Structure

- [`apps`](./apps) - Apps that only use packages and aren't aware of other apps.
- [`packages`](./packages) - Node packages that may use external and/or local packages.

### Apps

- [`apps/managed`](https://github.com/wcpos/managed-expo) - Expo managed app builds for Web, iOS and Android.

> yarn install
```

To start the web, iOS and Android development build, use:
